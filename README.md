# Syntaxic
Open source component of the [Syntaxic text editor](https://syntaxiceditor.com).

This repository includes language definition files and themes in the `meta/` directory.

It includes some code in `code/` directory.  This will soon include more parts of the text editor.  But, for the time being it only holds the Linux/Mac TTY wrapper used for implementing the shell.

The API definitions for the Javascript plugin system are here (see `api.js`).

Finally, a small (but growing) collection of plugins is in `plugins/`.

Please let me know your comments, either through GitHub, or through support@kpartite.com .
