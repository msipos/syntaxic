# syntaxic
Open source component of the [Syntaxic text editor](https://syntaxiceditor.com).

This repository includes language definition files and themes in the meta/ directory.

It includes some code in code/ directory.  This will soon include more parts of the text editor.  But, for the time being it only holds the Linux/Mac TTY wrapper used for the shell.

Finally, the API definitions for the Javascript plugin system are here.

Please let me know your comments, either through GitHub, or through support@kpartite.com .
